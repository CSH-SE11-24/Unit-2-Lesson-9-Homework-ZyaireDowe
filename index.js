// PART 1: printing with prompt
// Prompt the user for a number and cast it to a number

let user=prompt("Enter a number")
// Prompt the user for another number that is bigger than the first number and cast it to a number
let num2=prompt("Enter another number that is bigger than the first")

// Write a JavaScript program that uses a for loop to print all numbers from the first number to the second number
for(let x = first;x <= sec; x==){
  console.log(x)
}






// PART 2: Averaging an array
// Create an array of numbers 

let numbers=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Write a for loop that calculates the sum of the elements 






// Using the sum, calculate the average of all the elements (sum divided by the length of the array)
